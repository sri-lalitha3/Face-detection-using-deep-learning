- High detection accuracy (90%+)
- Docker-ready deployment support
- Scalable and modular design

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Deep Learning
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch
- Haar Cascade Classifier
- Docker

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Captures live video feed or image input
2. Applies preprocessing and feature extraction
3. Uses deep learning-based models for face detection
4. Displays detected faces in real-time

## 📊 Results
- Achieved over **90% face detection accuracy**
- Tested on real-time video streams
- Optimized for performance and scalability

## 🛠️ How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
